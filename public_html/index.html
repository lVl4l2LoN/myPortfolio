            <p>Hello World! <br> Now that I have your attention, allow me to 
             introduce myself. My name is Marlon. 
             I prefer to talk less, but typing is a different matter. In fact 
             most of my communication is done fluidly on keyboard. Verbal speech
             is something that I have yet to master; though, I do my best to be 
             better at it than I was yesterday. Take your time exploring this
             web blog. By the end of your tour, you will see how awesome I am.
